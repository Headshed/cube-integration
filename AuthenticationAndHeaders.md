## HTTPS
HTTPS is required for accessing the API.

## HTTP Basic Authentication
HTTP Basic authentication is the simplest way of interacting with the Cube API. Requests require a username and password. ```Authorization: Basic (insert your authentication string here)```

Your authentication string is a base64 encoded version of your credentials. You can generate this in Python:
`base64.b64encode("myemail@example.com:password")`

Or in JavaScript:
`btoa("myemail@example.com:password")`


## Token based authentication
Headshed Cube recommend Token-based authentication.
The token must be placed in the Header: ```Authorization: Token (insert your token here)```
Tokens can be generated by tenant administrators for any user profile. Users can see their token on their individual user profile page.

### Headers
In addition to one of the Authentication headers, the Request need to be set up with the following to show that we use json:
```
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```
