## Customer data API - Retrieving updated customer data.
The following request can be used to get Customer data from Cube:
GET
```
https://YOURACCOUNT.headshed.com/crm/assignment_id/{assignment_id}/customers
```
> HTTP Response: 200 OK

## Example
In this example, we have asked for all Customer records in assignment #9. What type of assignment this is can be seen in the Cube GUI. (We will add API support for listing assignment information).
Assignment #9 in this example have been configured as a B2B-assignment (Customer records are companies), and 6 assignment specific extra information fields have been configured:
(Add image to show configuration)
In the customer record shown below, only 3 of the assignment specific fields have data registered, and hence only these are displayed/included in the response.
For standard customer data fields, the fields are shown (with `null` values when no data is registered)
